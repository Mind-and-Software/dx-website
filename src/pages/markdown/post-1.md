blurb: 'TL;DR Knowledgeable developers are like royalty that’s hard to please. But they’re irreplaceable. Yes, you can substitute employees, but if they’re less skilled, you might end up with costly refactoring. If you value the experienced team you have, consider working on what’s called the developer experience to keep them eager and comfortable.'

What Is a Good Developer Experience

The Developer Experience (DX) describes the experience developers have while using or working on your product. It is a package of positive and also negative feelings. In many companies, dealing with DX is often secondary to trying to make a User Experience (UX) as good as possible. This approach is unfortunate - developers are users too! They use your product, frameworks, tools, etc. and they have some experience of using it. It is up to you to decide if this experience is going to be a good one or a bad one. But remember, their satisfaction and happiness are crucial for the success of your project. Happy developers create exceptional software in the long term. A positive developer experience, ensures that your developers are happy, satisfied, and less likely to leave your team.

We define a great DX by these four factors:

1. Fitting architecture  
   Find a compromise between simple and more complex architecture. Simple means more pain later, complex brings more pain now. Consider the size of your project and your team. Good architecture is difficult to break, has short feedback loops and it has a great introspection.

2. Great tools  
   Automate where possible. Repetitive tasks are exhausting. Automation lets your team understand the configurations.

3. Processes to back that all up  
   Processes work as automated checklists, and give you have consistent steps that need to be done each time. Defined processes help you with team discipline. Use processes for QA, deployment, feedback, and for onboarding if your company is big enough.

4. Nontoxic team culture  
   Define the purpose of your company: making money should not be the only goal. Culture itself is the most important brainware (a software that runs in the brain)
